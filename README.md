# nvim-markdown-preview

Markdown preview in the browser using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) through Neovim's [job-control API](https://neovim.io/doc/user/job_control.html).

## Usage

Open a markdown file in vim and run `:MarkdownPreview`. The preview opens in a new browser tab which will be reloaded whenever you `:write` the buffer. If you accidentally close your browser tab or want to change the theme just run the command again. The file needs to be written to disk before you can start the preview.

## Features

* Asynchronous
* Produces "standalone" html files (injected css)
* Custom themes (`github`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`)
* Auto-reloads browser tab on save
* Serves assets from the current working directory (embed pictures in your markdown etc.)

## Requirements

* `pandoc`
* `live-server` (Node.js)

`pandoc` and `live-server` executables should be installed and accessible in your `$PATH`. Please see the links in the description on how to install these programs on your system.

On macOS it could look something like:

```
$ brew install pandoc
$ npm install -g live-server

(or if you prefer yarn)

$ yarn global add live-server
```
## Installation

If you are using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

`Plug 'davidgranstrom/nvim-markdown-preview'`

source the file (or restart vim) and then run `:PlugInstall`

## Documentation

Take a look at `:help nvim-markdown-preview` for documentation and examples.

## Q/A

**Q:** Why doesn't the preview update in real-time while I type in vim?

**A:** This plugin simply doesn't work like that. It is aimed to be "lightweigth" (if you already are a node.js/pandoc user that is).
It simply provides some live update capabilities around what is essentially `:w !pandoc % -o /tmp/file.html`

**Q:** I want the preview tab to open automatically without typing `:MarkdownPreview`

**A:** Sure, use an `autocmd` like:
```
autocmd FileType markdown MarkdownPreview
```

Or the `<Plug>` mapping to bind it to the key of your choice
```
nmap <cr> <plug>(nvim-markdown-preview)
```

## TODO

The markdown file must be written to disk first. It should be possible to use Pandoc `stdin` and pipe the buffer content using `jobsend()` instead.
